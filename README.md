The toolkit utilizes various commands and features for penetration testing:

Port Scanning: To scan open ports on a remote server.

python tool.py --scan-ports <target_ip>

SQL Injection Testing: Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

python tool.py --sql-injection <target_url>

Brute Force Password Cracking: Crack a password using a wordlist.

python tool.py --brute-force <target_url> --wordlist <path_to_wordlist>

XSS Scanning: Scan for XSS vulnerabilities.

python tool.py --xss-scan <target_url>

Directory Brute-Forcing: Brute-force directories on a server.

python tool.py --dir-bruteforce <target_url> --wordlist <path_to_wordlist>

Subdomain Finder: Discover subdomains associated with a domain.

python tool.py --subdomain-find <domain>



---

Wordlists

You can use the included wordlists or customize them for specific tasks. Below are the commonly used wordlists for different modules:

ports_common.txt ‚Äì For common port numbers.

sql_injection_payloads.txt ‚Äì For SQL injection payloads.

passwords_common.txt ‚Äì For brute-forcing passwords.

xss_payloads.txt ‚Äì For XSS payloads.

directories_common.txt ‚Äì For directory brute-forcing.

subdomains_common.txt ‚Äì For subdomain enumeration.


You can also download additional wordlists from SecLists or use other public repositories.
